# LSTM_project_for_sentiment_analysis
This is project entails the development of Long Short Term Memory networks to perform sentiment analysis. The model architecture recieves the input data & moves it through an embedding layer, two LSTM layers and then a final linear output layer.
The project contains 2 seperate notebooks, one representing sentiment analysis for financial news data & the other for product review data.
The project is split into Data analysis, pre_processing, model training & evaluation.
The same model architecture was built for both notebooks & they were developed with the Keras library, notable sub-modules include Sequential,Layers and Callbacks,libraries used for Data analysis & feature engineering include, Pandas,seaborn,re,Keras.preprocessing,sklearn.feature_extraction & sklean.model_selection(for train_test_split).
3 datasets were used in this project,lstm_main is the training dataset of the financial sentiment model and a combination of smaller locally sourced datasets,lstm_sub is the validation dataset of the financial sentiment model and was sourced from kaggle,Amazon_reviews represent both the training & validation dataset for the prodict sentiment model and was also sourced from kaggle, all 3 datasets contain only the text and label columns.
The financial sentiment notebook was run locally with jupyter on a CPU machine while the product sentiment notebook was built on google collab powered by a GPU.
